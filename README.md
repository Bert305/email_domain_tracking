# email_domain_tracking Analysis Project

## Email Domain Analysis Tool (app.py)

## Overview for app.py
This Python-based tool efficiently analyzes email domains from a provided CSV file. It extracts domains, segregates them between business and personal categories, and calculates the occurrence and percentage of each domain type. This tool is essential for organizations looking to understand email traffic sources and enhance email management strategies.

## Features
- **Domain Extraction:** Extracts the domain from each email address in the input CSV file.
- **Domain Categorization:** Identifies and filters personal email domains, focusing analysis on business-related email traffic.
- **Count and Percentage Calculation:** Calculates the frequency of each domain and the percentage it represents of the total email count.
- **Output Files:** Generates multiple CSV files that list business and personal email domains, their counts, and percentages.

## How to Use
1. **Prepare Your Data:** Ensure your CSV file contains a column named `email` with the email addresses. Save this file as `emails.csv`.
2. **Run the Script:** Execute the main script to analyze the email domains. The script will output CSV files with detailed domain data.
3. **Review Results:** Check the generated CSV files for a breakdown of email domain occurrences and their categorization.

## Output
The tool generates the following files:
- `business_email_analysis.csv` - Lists business email domains along with their counts and percentages.
- `personal_email_analysis.csv` - Lists personal email domains along with their counts and percentages.
- `business_emails_list.csv` - Contains all emails classified as business emails with their respective domains.
- `personal_emails_list.csv` - Contains all emails classified as personal emails with their respective domains.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- Pandas library

Install Pandas using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas
```

# Email Domain Counter (domain_output.py)

## Overview for domain_output.py
This Python script is designed to process a CSV file containing email addresses, extract the domain part of each email, count the frequency of each domain, and output the results. This simple yet effective tool can be invaluable for data analysis tasks where understanding email domain distribution is necessary.

## Features
- **Domain Extraction:** Extracts the domain part from each email address in the provided CSV file.
- **Domain Count:** Calculates the frequency of each extracted domain to determine their distribution within the dataset.
- **CSV Output:** Outputs the domain counts to a CSV file for easy analysis and sharing.
- **Dual Output Mode:** Optionally, saves a copy of the original data with the extracted domains for further analysis.

## How to Use
1. **Prepare Your Data:** Ensure that your input CSV file is named `emails.csv` and contains a column of email addresses. This column should not have a specific header requirement as the script assumes only one column of emails.
2. **Run the Script:** Execute the script in your Python environment. Ensure Pandas is installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas
   ```
3. **Check Outputs:**
   - `email_domains_count.csv`: Contains each unique domain and its count.
   - `emails_with_domains.csv` (optional): Contains the original emails along with their extracted domains.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- Pandas library

## Installation
To set up your environment to run this script, install Pandas using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas
```

## Contributing
Your contributions to enhance this script are welcome! Suggestions on improving domain extraction accuracy, handling different email formats, or optimizing performance would be particularly valuable. Feel free to fork this repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
